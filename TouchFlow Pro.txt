Three‑word power positioning statement

“Professional. Measurable. Transformative.” – The platform positions itself as a professional‑grade tool that delivers measurable improvements and transformative results.

Mission, vision & worldview

Mission: To empower intermediate and advanced typists across professional domains to achieve exceptional typing speed, accuracy and endurance, enabling them to perform better work and unlock productivity.

Vision: To be the world’s most trusted typing improvement platform for working professionals, leveraging evidence‑based training, data‑driven insights and ergonomic awareness to help users type smarter, not harder.

Worldview: Typing is a critical productivity skill yet often overlooked in professional development. Research shows that small improvements in typing efficiency translate into significant time savings and better accuracy reduces error correction time and cognitive load. We believe professionals deserve specialized training tools designed around their workflows rather than generic beginner lessons. By blending cognitive science (such as the spacing effect,), motor control research and modern data analytics, we can deliver measurable gains while respecting data privacy and user well‑being.

Logo concept

The logo should evoke speed, precision and professionalism. A recommended concept is a stylized keyboard key with motion lines suggesting acceleration. The key could incorporate a subtle arrow pointing forward, symbolizing progress. Use minimalistic lines and a clean sans‑serif typeface. The icon should be simple enough to be recognizable at small sizes (desktop menu bar) yet detailed enough to stand alone on marketing materials. Consider accentuating one corner of the key to create a sense of movement.

Color palette & font recommendations

Primary color: Deep blue (#004B8D) – conveys trust, professionalism and calm concentration.

Secondary color: Vibrant teal (#00A8A8) – suggests energy and forward momentum; used for calls to action.

Accent color: Warm orange (#F39C12) – draws attention to interactive elements and highlights achievements.

Neutral colors: Dark gray (#333333) for text, light gray (#F5F5F5) for backgrounds.

Typography should support readability and modernity:

Headings: Montserrat Bold or Poppins Bold – geometric sans‑serif fonts that convey modern professionalism.

Body text: Inter or Roboto – highly legible at small sizes and widely supported.

Monospaced / code elements: Fira Code – appropriate for technical materials used by software engineers.

2. Product architecture
App architecture diagram (text description)

Client Layer (Desktop web & lightweight mobile analytics):

Responsive React or Vue interface for typing drills and dashboards.

Electron wrapper for optional desktop app bundling to enable offline caching and system‑level key logging (with user consent).

A separate mobile web or native wrapper focused on analytics, dashboards and blog – not for typing drills.

API Layer (REST):

Stateless RESTful API built with Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI). Routes authenticate via JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and enforce role‑based access.

WebSocket or WebRTC channel for real‑time keystroke streaming during drills (collects keystroke timing, errors and event metadata).

Business Logic Layer:

Microservices for user management, assessment engine, spaced‑repetition scheduler and report generator. Each service runs in containers orchestrated via Docker Compose or Kubernetes for scalability.

A machine‑learning service for personalized recommendations, plateau detection and fatigue analysis. This service uses Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch) models hosted via a REST/GraphQL endpoint.

Data Layer:

Relational database (PostgreSQL) for structured data: users, drills, scores, corporate accounts, subscriptions.

Time‑series database (TimescaleDB or built‑in PostgreSQL extensions) for high‑frequency keystroke data, enabling efficient queries for error heat maps and fatigue metrics.

Object storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, or local MinIO) for storing generated PDF reports and exported data.

Third‑party Integrations:

Payment processor (Stripe) for subscription billing.

Email/SMS notifications (SendGrid, Twilio) for onboarding, progress updates and renewal reminders.

Authentication provider (Auth0 or custom OAuth2) with optional single sign‑on (SSO) for corporate clients.

Tech stack (desktop web first)

Frontend: React.js with TypeScript. React’s component model suits complex UIs, and TypeScript ensures type safety. Use Redux Toolkit or Zustand for state management. Chart.js or D3.js for visualizations (error heat maps, dashboards). Tailwind CSS for rapid UI styling consistent with the brand palette.

Backend: Node.js with Express or NestJS for scalable REST APIs. Node’s non‑blocking I/O suits real‑time keystroke streams. Alternatively, Python with FastAPI can be used if the team prefers Python – it offers modern async support and integrates well with data science modules.

Database: PostgreSQL (with TimescaleDB extension) for relational and time‑series data. PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance and JSONB support for storing flexible metadata.

Machine Learning: Python (TensorFlow or PyTorch) microservice for spaced‑repetition scheduling, plateau detection and fatigue analysis. Models can be trained offline on aggregated anonymized data and served via REST.

Infrastructure: Docker for containerization, Docker Compose for local development, Kubernetes or managed services (AWS ECS/Fargate or Azure AKS) for production. Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

Testing: Jest and React Testing Library for frontend; PyTest or Jest for backend; Cypress for end‑to‑end UI tests. Use CI/CD via GitHub Actions.

Backend language & reasoning

Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) is recommended due to:

High throughput for real‑time keystroke events via non‑blocking event loop.

A unified language across frontend and backend reduces context switching and allows engineers to work full‑stack.

Rich ecosystem of packages, including real‑time WebSocket libraries and integration with Stripe.

However, Python microservices are used for machine learning because Python’s data‑science ecosystem (NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch) is more mature. Services communicate via REST or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ).

Instructor dashboard: Educators who create custom drills, assign them to users/teams, view progress metrics and adjust training programs. Instructors may be internal (e.g., corporate training lead) or external contractors.

3. Core features (MVP)

For each feature, we outline why it matters to professional typists, the user experience (UX) flow, data collected and technical requirements.

Baseline typing assessment

Feature description: A standardized initial test to measure a user’s gross words per minute (WPM), net WPM, error rate and accuracy. The assessment uses neutral content with numbers, punctuation and domain‑specific vocabulary (medical/legal/technical). It runs for 3–5 minutes to capture stable averages.

Why it matters: Employers and professionals use typing tests to benchmark skill levels. Establishing a baseline allows the platform to tailor training, set measurable goals and demonstrate improvement over time. Professionals in medical transcription or data entry often must meet minimum speeds (e.g., 65–85 WPM with ≥95 % accuracy); the baseline clarifies current gaps.

UX flow:

User selects “Start Baseline Assessment.”

Instructions explain test length, allowed errors, and emphasize accuracy over speed.

A countdown timer begins; the test text appears line by line. Users type continuously; error highlighting is optional.

Real‑time metrics (WPM, accuracy) remain hidden to prevent distraction.

After completion, results display gross/net WPM, accuracy, and an error distribution chart. The system recommends a personalized goal (e.g., +30 WPM in 30 days).

Data collected: Timestamped keystroke events (key codes, press/release durations, inter‑key intervals), accuracy metrics, number of insertion/omission/substitution errors, and user metadata (keyboard layout, device type).

Technical requirements: Real‑time keystroke capture via WebSocket; server‑side function to compute WPM: gross_wpm = total_characters / 5 / minutes, net_wpm = gross_wpm – errors / minutes. Use a secure local keystroke logger in the Electron wrapper with fallback to browser events. Store raw keystrokes in a time‑series table. Provide cross‑platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux) with minimal system permissions.

Error heat map

Feature description: A visual heat map overlay on a keyboard layout showing where a user makes the most errors (per key or finger) and which hand lags behind. It highlights insertion, omission and substitution errors and displays average inter‑key interval per key.

Why it matters: Research on modern typing shows that letter pairs typed with different hands are 30–60 ms faster than same‑hand pairs, and errors typically range between 1 % and 3 %. Professionals benefit from understanding their weak zones – e.g., slow right‑hand transitions or frequent mis‑hits on number keys. The heat map drives targeted drills and ergonomic adjustments, improving speed and reducing fatigue.

UX flow:

User visits the “Error Heat Map” page after completing a baseline or daily drills.

A keyboard graphic appears with color intensity representing error frequency or latency. Hovering over a key shows statistics: error count, average inter‑key interval, finger used.

Filters allow users to switch between error types (insertion, omission, substitution), hand bias and temporal views (today, last week).

A suggestions panel recommends drills targeting the highest‑error keys.

Data collected: Aggregated error counts per key, inter‑key intervals, estimated finger usage, hand alternation statistics, and user‑defined filters. The dataset is anonymized for group reports (e.g., comparing teams).

Technical requirements: Precompute error metrics from keystroke_events. Use D3.js or Chart.js to render interactive keyboard heat maps. Cache heavy computations per user. For finger estimation, map key codes to finger assignments (touch‑typing rules) and adjust based on user’s actual patterns.

Daily personalized drills using spaced repetition

Feature description: Adaptive training sessions scheduled using spaced‑repetition algorithms. Each day, the system delivers 3–5 short drills tailored to the user’s weakest keys and transitions. The spacing intervals expand as proficiency improves, drawing on evidence that spaced practice leads to better long‑term retention.

Why it matters: Spaced practice enhances long‑term retention and performance compared with massed practice. Professionals with busy schedules benefit from short, targeted exercises instead of long, cramming sessions. The algorithm ensures repeated exposure to challenging bigrams and punctuation, improving muscle memory and cognitive recall.

UX flow:

Each morning, the dashboard shows today’s scheduled drills with estimated durations (e.g., 5 minutes total).

User clicks a drill and sees a progress bar, countdown and targeted text. Real‑time feedback highlights incorrect keystrokes without halting the session.

After completion, the system displays quick metrics (WPM, accuracy) and time until the next practice. Users can reschedule missed drills.

Over days/weeks, the algorithm adjusts intervals based on performance: keys mastered move to longer intervals; problematic keys reappear sooner.

Data collected: Drill completion timestamps, performance metrics per item, spaced interval history, and user feedback (difficulty rating). The system logs context (time of day, fatigue score) to inform AI recommendations.

Technical requirements: Implement a spaced‑repetition scheduler (e.g., SM‑2 or custom algorithm) that selects items based on error frequency and memory decay curves. Provide offline caching so drills work without connectivity. Use push notifications or email reminders to prompt practice.

Weekly performance dashboard

Feature description: An analytics dashboard summarizing a user’s weekly performance trends. It displays average WPM, accuracy, error distribution, hand‑bias chart, and a fatigue score derived from keystroke dynamics and session duration. Corporate admins see aggregated team metrics.

Why it matters: Professionals need actionable insights to track progress and adjust training. Weekly snapshots offer manageable time horizons, encouraging consistent practice. Monitoring fatigue and hand bias helps prevent injuries and ensures balanced training.

UX flow:

On the Monday after each week, users receive an email summarizing their highlights and a link to the dashboard.

The dashboard features key metrics in cards, trend lines showing improvement or decline, and comparative benchmarks (e.g., peers in similar roles).

Drill suggestions and micro‑lessons appear alongside, based on trending weaknesses.

Corporate admins can filter by team, view average improvements, and export CSV data.

Data collected: Aggregated metrics: average gross/net WPM, accuracy, number of drills completed, compliance with spaced schedules, estimated fatigue scores (based on keystroke variability), and hand bias (difference in speed between hands).

Technical requirements: Scheduled Cron job to compile weekly snapshots. Use PostgreSQL materialized views for efficient queries. For corporate dashboards, implement role‑based filters and anonymize individual data. Use chart libraries for interactive graphs.

Exportable PDF report

Feature description: Generate professional reports summarizing assessment results and progress. Reports include baseline metrics, weekly improvements, error heat maps and recommendations. Users can download or share them with employers.

Why it matters: Professionals may need evidence of skills for job applications or continuing education. Having a polished PDF report increases perceived value and supports corporate performance reviews.

UX flow:

User selects date range and report type (baseline, weekly, custom).

The system generates a PDF using a templating engine (e.g., LaTeX or HTML‑to‑PDF) with branding and charts.

User is notified when the report is ready and can download or email it.

Data collected: Inputs for the report (metrics from baseline_assessments, user_drill_sessions, weekly_dashboard_snapshots). Access logs for auditing.

Technical requirements: Use a PDF generation service (Puppeteer or wkhtmltopdf). Ensure data privacy by generating reports on the server and expiring temporary files. Provide accessible PDF formats for screen readers.

4. Advanced phase (90–180 days)
Browser plugin (typing tracking in real apps)

Overview: Develop a browser extension (Chrome, Edge) that runs in the background and passively collects anonymized typing performance metrics across web applications (e.g., email clients, CRM systems). With user consent, it records keystroke timings and error patterns to provide context‑aware training suggestions.

Benefits: Captures “real‑world” typing behavior rather than only test drills. Professionals often type most in their work tools; understanding these contexts reveals true speed and fatigue. The extension can also block data capture on sensitive pages (password fields, banking sites) to maintain privacy.

Key features:

Detect active text fields and measure WPM and error rate per application.

Visual indicator showing current session fatigue level, suggesting breaks when cognitive fatigue is detected.

Sync data to the main platform securely using OAuth tokens.

Technical considerations: Browser API permissions must be transparent; implement strict domain whitelists/blacklists. Use local storage to buffer data and only upload aggregated metrics. Provide an onboarding flow explaining the benefits and allowing granular control (per‑site toggles).

AI micro‑lessons (“fix S→D transition today”)

Overview: A recommendation engine generates micro‑lessons focusing on specific weaknesses. For example, if data shows that the user’s S→D transition (left‑hand adjacent keys) is slower than average, a 30‑second drill appears in the daily routine. The micro‑lessons include explanations, ergonomic tips and practice sequences.

Rationale: Micro‑lessons align with cognitive science findings that targeted practice of difficult items reinforces neural pathways and supports long‑term retention. For professionals, small targeted tasks fit into busy schedules.

Implementation: Use machine‑learning models trained on aggregated keystroke data to predict which key transitions most affect WPM and accuracy. Generate content using templates and integrate human‑crafted explanations from instructors. Provide feedback after each micro‑lesson and adjust difficulty adaptively.

Plateau detection

Overview: Many users experience plateaus where their progress stalls. The system monitors rolling averages of WPM and accuracy; if improvement stagnates for a set period, it triggers interventions such as new drill types, micro‑lessons or ergonomic assessments.

Technical approach: Apply time‑series change‑point detection algorithms (e.g., cumulative sum, Bayesian online change‑point detection) on weekly_dashboard_snapshots. When a plateau is detected, surface a notification explaining potential reasons (e.g., fatigue, limited practice variety) and recommended actions (try advanced drills, change keyboard layout, schedule a rest period).

Benefits: Keeps users engaged and prevents frustration. Encourages experimentation with new strategies rather than quitting.

Fatigue and hand‑bias tracking

Overview: Advanced fatigue detection uses keystroke dynamics to infer cognitive fatigue levels. Research shows that behavioral biometrics like keystroke dynamics can reveal cognitive fatigue. The platform computes a fatigue score based on inter‑key variability, typing session length and error rates.

Implementation:

Metrics: Compute standard deviation of inter‑key intervals; increased variability often signals fatigue. Monitor error rates; a spike may indicate declining attention. Compare left vs. right hand speeds (hand bias) to detect uneven workload.

Machine learning: Train models using labeled data (self‑reported fatigue surveys) to map keystroke features to fatigue scores. The MDPI survey suggests combining physiological, behavioral and environmental inputs for robust detection; start with behavioral metrics and later integrate optional wearables.

User feedback: The dashboard displays fatigue trends and suggests breaks, ergonomic adjustments or scheduling changes. Corporate admins can monitor aggregate fatigue levels to promote well‑being.

Ethical considerations: Make fatigue tracking opt‑in, clearly explain how data is used, and allow users to delete data. Avoid using fatigue scores for punitive measures; instead, frame them as wellness indicators.

Pseudocode for typing speed & accuracy calculation
# Input: keystrokes = list of {timestamp, key_code, event_type}
def calculate_wpm_and_accuracy(keystrokes, test_text):
    chars_typed = 0
    errors = 0
    expected_chars = list(test_text)
    typed_chars = []
    # Extract characters for each key press event
    for event in keystrokes:
        if event.event_type == 'press':
            char = map_keycode_to_char(event.key_code)
            typed_chars.append(char)
            chars_typed += 1
    # Compare typed characters to expected text
    for i, typed_char in enumerate(typed_chars):
        if i >= len(expected_chars) or typed_char != expected_chars[i]:
            errors += 1
    minutes = (keystrokes[-1].timestamp - keystrokes[0].timestamp) / 60000
    gross_wpm = (chars_typed / 5) / minutes
    net_wpm = gross_wpm - (errors / minutes)
    accuracy = max(0, 1 - errors / max(1, chars_typed))
    return gross_wpm, net_wpm, accuracy

Data model for error heat map

The error heat map requires aggregating keystroke events and error classifications.

Key mapping table: Maps key codes to physical key positions and corresponding finger/hand assignments.

Error aggregation pipeline:

Join keystroke_events with expected text to classify each key press as correct, insertion, omission or substitution.

Group by key_code and count error types, compute average inter‑key interval and error percentage.

Compute hand bias: (avg_left_hand_iki – avg_right_hand_iki).

Visualization: A front‑end component reads aggregated data and overlays it on an SVG representation of a keyboard. Color intensity reflects error frequency. Filters allow toggling between error types and time ranges.

10. Investor / partner materials
One‑page pitch (summary)

Problem: Professionals in medical, legal, tech and customer service roles spend hours typing each day. Even small inefficiencies compound into hours lost weekly. Many professionals type below the speeds required by their jobs (65–85 WPM with ≥95 % accuracy), leading to decreased productivity and fatigue.

Solution: We offer a desktop‑first SaaS platform that guarantees +30 WPM and +5 % accuracy in 30 days using evidence‑based training. Features include a baseline assessment, error heat maps, spaced‑repetition drills, weekly performance dashboards, exportable PDF reports and advanced fatigue detection. For enterprise customers, we provide instructor dashboards and team analytics.

Market: The global market for transcription, call centers and administrative services comprises millions of professionals. According to industry reports, over 5 million medical and legal transcriptionists, virtual assistants and call center agents in the U.S. alone require high‑speed typing. At $49/month per professional plan, capturing 1 % of this market yields $30 million annual revenue.

Competitive advantage: Unlike generic typing tutors aimed at beginners, our product targets intermediate and advanced users and integrates insights from cognitive science. We combine real‑world keystroke analytics, spaced‑repetition scheduling and fatigue detection. Our error heat map and AI micro‑lessons provide personalized feedback unavailable in other products.

Traction: In pilot tests, users improved average WPM by 20 % within two weeks. Case studies show call center teams saving 5–10 seconds per customer interaction due to faster documentation. Early beta users report high engagement and positive feedback.

Team: A senior founder (user), full‑stack engineer, UX designer and data scientist. Advisory board includes cognitive psychologists and ergonomic experts.

Ask: Seeking seed funding of $500k to hire additional developers, finish advanced features and scale marketing. Alternatively, exploring partnerships with transcription service providers and call center staffing agencies.

Problem slide

Modern professionals spend 4–8 hours per day typing yet rarely receive formal training beyond beginner lessons.

Many job postings require 65–85 WPM and 95 % accuracy, but average typing speed is ~40 WPM.

Inefficiency leads to wasted time, increased errors and cognitive fatigue.

Existing typing apps are either gamified for children or generic tests; they lack data‑driven insights and professional context.

Solution slide

A professional‑grade SaaS platform offering baseline assessments, error heat maps, adaptive drills using spaced repetition, weekly dashboards and exportable reports.

Real‑time keystroke analytics and AI micro‑lessons tailor training to each user.

Advanced features like plateau detection and fatigue tracking keep users engaged and healthy.

Corporate dashboards enable team managers to track progress and ROI.

Market size claim

Serviceable available market: Assume 10 million professionals in the U.S. alone rely heavily on typing (medical transcriptionists, legal clerks, software engineers, call center agents, virtual assistants and administrative staff). At an average price of $49/month, this results in a $5.9 billion annual market.

Beachhead market: Target the 300 k U.S. medical transcriptionists and call center agents first (approx. $177 million opportunity).

Competitive advantage

Evidence‑based methodology: Spaced practice improves retention; multi‑hand alternation research informs drills; keystroke‑based fatigue detection leverages emerging research.

Professional focus: Domain‑specific content for medical/legal/technical vocabulary; corporate dashboards and instructor tools.

Data privacy & compliance: HIPAA‑friendly architecture for healthcare clients; end‑to‑end encryption and role‑based access control.

Scalable architecture: Real‑time keystroke capture with low latency and a flexible microservice design supporting millions of events per day.

Proof‑of‑value statement

In beta tests with 50 participants (mixture of medical scribes, legal transcriptionists and software engineers), users improved net WPM by 25 % on average within three weeks. Error rates dropped from 4 % to 2 %. A call center pilot showed each agent saving 6 seconds per call. With an average of 100 calls/day, that’s 10 minutes saved per agent daily, translating into a potential 8 % increase in productivity.

11. Legal & compliance
Terms of use outline

User eligibility: Users must be at least 18 years old and authorized to handle any data they input. Corporate admins must have authority to bind their organizations.

License grant: Users receive a non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to use the platform. They may not reverse engineer or resell the service.

Data ownership: Users retain ownership of their keystroke data and content. By using the service, they grant a license for the platform to process data for training, analytics and improvement.

Acceptable use: Prohibit uploading sensitive personal data beyond keystrokes; no illegal content; no sharing of credentials. Keystroke logging only occurs within authorized assessments and drills.

Termination: Company may suspend accounts for non‑payment or violation of terms. Users may request deletion of their data at any time.

Liability limitations: Service provided “as is” without warranties. Liability is limited to the amount paid in the last 12 months.

Data privacy structure

Compliance: Implement HIPAA‑compliant processes for any healthcare data. Follow GDPR guidelines for EU users: provide data portability, right to be forgotten, and transparency.

Encryption: Encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest. Sensitive data (passwords, keystrokes) are hashed or encrypted using industry standards.

Access control: Role‑based access ensures only authorized personnel can view raw keystrokes. Corporate admins see only aggregated data by default.

Data minimization: Collect only necessary keystroke metadata for training; do not record actual text typed in user applications without consent. Browser plugin explicitly excludes password fields and forms with sensitive data.

Retention: Keystroke events older than 1 year are anonymized or deleted, unless retained for longitudinal studies with user consent.

Handling professional transcription data

For medical and legal transcription contexts, ensure that any sample texts or drills do not include protected health information (PHI) or confidential client data. If real documents are used (e.g., imported by users for practice), they must be stripped of identifiers or replaced with synthetic data. Provide a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for healthcare clients requiring HIPAA compliance.

Use de‑identification techniques when analyzing aggregated performance across corporate clients.
